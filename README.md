# From Raw Data To Intelligent Predictions
A study on forecasting Electrical Demand with TensorFlow

## The Challenge: Can We Predict the Energy Future?
The aim of this project was straightforward: to take a time series of electricity consumption and build an AI model capable of predicting future demand. I started with a univariate approach, using only the consumption history to forecast its own future. Why? To establish a solid baseline and see how "intelligent" the model could be with minimal information.

## Strategic Decision: Why Conv1D Instead of the Classic LSTM?
This is where my first major architectural decision came in. Instead of opting for an LSTM, the standard for sequences, I chose a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D).
I wanted a more modern and computationally efficient approach. Conv1D networks are like forensic specialists: they scan all the evidence (the sequence) in parallel to find 'fingerprints' or local patterns. They are incredibly fast and effective, a perfect choice for a problem where recent patterns are key.

## The Architecture: Less is More
The heart of the model is its simplicity. A Conv1D for feature extraction, MaxPooling1D to summarize, and Dense for the final prediction.

## The blueprint of our "prediction factory":
- Input Layer: Shape (144, 1)
- Conv1D Layer: 64 filters, kernel size of 3, activation 'relu'
- MaxPooling1D Layer: Pool size of 2
- Flatten Layer
- Dense Layer: 1 unit for output

## Roadmap: How to Take This Project to the Next Level?
A good project not only shows what has been done but also demonstrates a vision for the future. Here's my plan for a V2:
**Multivariate Analysis:** The most important step. I would integrate external data like temperature and humidity. Electricity consumption doesn't live in a bubble, and these external factors are crucial for more accurate predictions.
**Hybrid Models (Conv1D + LSTM):** Combine the best of both worlds! Use a Conv1D layer to efficiently process and extract patterns, then feed that output to an LSTM layer to capture long-term dependencies.
**Feature Engineering:** Provide more context to the model. I would create new columns like the time of day, day of the week, or if it's a holiday. Context is everything!

## Conclusion
This project was a fascinating journey that demonstrates how a creative approach and well-thought-out architecture can achieve impressive results. The true science of data is not just in applying algorithms but in understanding the problem, justifying decisions, and charting a clear path for continuous improvement.
Thank you for joining me on this analysis!
